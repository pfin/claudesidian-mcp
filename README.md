# Nexus MCP for Obsidian

Nexus turns your Obsidian vault into an MCP-enabled workspace. It exposes safe, structured tools that AI copilots can call to read/write notes, manage folders, run searches, and maintain long-term memory—all while keeping data local to your vault.

> Nexus is the successor to Claudesidian. Legacy installs in `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/` still work.

---

## Highlights

- **Two-Tool Architecture** – Just 2 MCP tools (`getTools` + `useTool`) replace 50+ individual tools, reducing upfront token cost by ~95%.
- **Native Chat View** – Stream tool calls, branch conversations, and manage models directly inside Obsidian.
- **Workspace Memory** – Sessions, traces, and state snapshots in `.nexus/` (sync-friendly JSONL + local SQLite cache).
- **Local Semantic Search** – Desktop-only embeddings via sqlite-vec vector search—no external API calls.
- **Full Vault Operations** – Create, read, update, delete notes, folders, frontmatter, and batch edits.
- **Multi-Provider Support** – Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Perplexity, Requesty, plus local servers (Ollama, LM Studio).
- **Multi-Vault Ready** – Independent MCP instances per vault.

## Two-Tool Architecture

Nexus exposes exactly **2 tools** to MCP clients like Claude Desktop:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `toolManager_getTools` | **Discovery** – Returns schemas for requested agents/tools |
| `toolManager_useTool` | **Execution** – Runs tools with unified context |

### Why This Matters

- **~95% token reduction** in upfront schemas (~15,000 → ~500 tokens)
- Works great with small context window models (local LLMs)
- Context-first design captures memory/goal for every operation

### Context Schema

Every `useTool` call includes context that helps maintain continuity:

```typescript
{
  workspaceId: string;   // Scope identifier (name or UUID)
  sessionId: string;     // Session name (system assigns standard ID)
  memory: string;        // Conversation essence (1-3 sentences)
  goal: string;          // Current objective (1-3 sentences)
  constraints?: string;  // Rules/limits (1-3 sentences, optional)
}
```

### Available Agents & Tools

| Agent | Purpose | Key Tools |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **ContentManager** | Note reading/editing | readContent, createContent, appendContent, replaceContent, batchContent |
| **VaultManager** | File/folder management | listDirectory, createFolder, moveNote, duplicateNote |
| **VaultLibrarian** | Search operations | searchContent, searchDirectory, searchMemory |
| **MemoryManager** | Session/workspace/state | createSession, loadSession, createWorkspace, createState |
| **AgentManager** | Custom AI prompts | listModels, executePrompt, createAgent |
| **CommandManager** | Command palette | listCommands, executeCommand |

---

## Install

1. Download the latest release assets: `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, `main.js`, `connector.js`
2. Place them in `.obsidian/plugins/nexus/` (or keep legacy `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/`)
3. Enable **Nexus** in Obsidian Settings → Community Plugins
4. Restart Obsidian after first install

---

## Configure Claude Desktop

Add the Nexus server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexus-your-vault": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/Vault/.obsidian/plugins/nexus/connector.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the **one-click setup**: Settings → Nexus → Get Started → MCP Integration → **Add Nexus to Claude**

After adding, fully quit and relaunch Claude Desktop.

---

## Using Native Chat

1. Configure a provider in **Settings → Nexus → Providers**
2. Open chat via ribbon icon or command palette (**Nexus: Open Nexus Chat**)
3. Type `/` for tools, `@` for custom agents, `[[` to link notes
4. Tool calls stream live with collapsible result panels

---

## Workspace Memory

All data lives in `.nexus/` inside your vault:

```
.nexus/
├── conversations/*.jsonl  # Chat history (syncs across devices)
├── workspaces/*.jsonl     # Workspace events
└── cache.db               # SQLite cache (auto-rebuilt, not synced)
```

- Each tool call is tagged to a workspace and session automatically
- Create/load workspaces via tools or the chat UI
- No external database required

---

## Semantic Search

Use `vaultLibrarian.searchContent` with `semantic: true` for meaning-based search:

- **Desktop only** – Embeddings run locally via iframe-sandboxed transformers.js
- **Model**: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions, ~23MB, cached in IndexedDB)
- **First run** downloads the model (requires internet); subsequent runs are fully offline
- Watch the status bar for indexing progress; click to pause/resume

---

## Multi-Vault Setup

- Each vault runs its own MCP server with key `nexus-[vault-name]`
- Add one entry per vault in your MCP client config
- Keep vaults open to keep their servers reachable

---

## Security & Privacy

- MCP server binds locally only—no remote listeners
- All file operations stay inside the active vault
- Network calls only for remote LLM providers (per your API keys)
- Embeddings download once, then run fully on-device

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Server not found | Settings → Nexus → Get Started → MCP Integration → **Add Nexus to Claude**, then restart Claude Desktop |
| Pipes not created | Ensure Obsidian is open; Windows uses `nexus_mcp_<vault>` named pipes |
| WebLLM crashes | Currently disabled due to WebGPU bug on Apple Silicon; use Ollama or LM Studio |
| Legacy install | Paths to `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/connector.js` still work |

---

## Development

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run dev        # Development build with watch
npm run build      # Production build
npm run test       # Run tests
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```
